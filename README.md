# Cancer-Prediction-Model
My second data science project I would consider as Advanced Analytics, with use of Classification Trees and gradient boosting methods. We then also rectified class imbalance using methods like SMOTE to optimise our AUC score.

For easier reference and interpretation, kindly refer to the document *Report on Cancer Prediction Modelling with Class Imbalance.pdf*

# Run the code using Jupyter Notebook

First install the required modules using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Second run `jupyter notebook` and then select the file *Cancer Model Code_FINAL.ipynb*
